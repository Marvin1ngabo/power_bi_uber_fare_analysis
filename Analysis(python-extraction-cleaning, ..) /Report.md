# ðŸš—Uber Fare Analysis with Power BI


 ### 1.Introduction and Project Objective

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of Uber fare data, designed to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights into ride-sharing dynamics. Utilizing Python for data cleaning and feature engineering, and Power BI for interactive visualization, this dashboard aims to transform raw transaction data into actionable business intelligence.

 ### The primary objectives of this project are to:
 
  Clean and preprocess raw Uber fare data, addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.

  Engineer relevant features from existing data points to enrich the analysis (e.g., hour of day, trip distance).

  Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends related to Uber fares and ride volumes.

  Identify and highlight significant patterns, including temporal (hourly, daily, monthly, yearly) and geographical distributions of rides and fares.

  Provide actionable insights into peak demand periods, pricing variations, and passenger behaviors to support operational or strategic decision-making.

 ### 2.Methodology: Data Collection and Analysis Approach

 This project followed a structured analytical approach, moving from raw data acquisition and preprocessing to advanced feature engineering and interactive dashboard   creation.
 ### 2.1.Data Collection
 
 The dataset utilized for this analysis is the "New York City Taxi Fare Prediction" dataset (often used for Uber fare analysis due to its similar structure), publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset contains historical trip records, including fare amounts, pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, and passenger counts.

### 2.2.Tools and Technologies
 The analysis was conducted using a combination of powerful data science tools:

Python: Employed for robust data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering, leveraging libraries such as:

  ###### pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

  ###### numpy for numerical operations.

  ######  scikit-learn (though less explicitly used for modeling, its principles for data prep might apply).

  ######  matplotlib and seaborn for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) visualizations.

  ######  Power BI Desktop: Utilized for creating an interactive and visually compelling dashboard, enabling dynamic exploration of the data.
