# ðŸš—Uber Fare Analysis with Power BI


 ### Introduction and Project Objective

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of Uber fare data, designed to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights into ride-sharing dynamics. Utilizing Python for data cleaning and feature engineering, and Power BI for interactive visualization, this dashboard aims to transform raw transaction data into actionable business intelligence.

 ### The primary objectives of this project are to:
 
  Clean and preprocess raw Uber fare data, addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.

  Engineer relevant features from existing data points to enrich the analysis (e.g., hour of day, trip distance).

  Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends related to Uber fares and ride volumes.

  Identify and highlight significant patterns, including temporal (hourly, daily, monthly, yearly) and geographical distributions of rides and fares.

  Provide actionable insights into peak demand periods, pricing variations, and passenger behaviors to support operational or strategic decision-making.
